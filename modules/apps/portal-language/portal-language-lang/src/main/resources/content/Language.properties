index-commit-immediately=Index Commit Immediately
index-commit-immediately-help=Set this to true to immediately commit search index write requests. Setting this to true may negatively impact search engine performance as each write request will force the search engine to refresh the index reader and potentially flush transactions to disk. The default behavior of the portal is to commit immediately for individual index operations (e.g. add blog, update blog) but delay commits for bulk operations (e.g. index all users, index all wikis) until all entries have been sent to the search engine. Setting this to false may cause widgets like Asset Publisher to exhibit a delayed response when showing newly added content. For example, users may experience a delay with the default Elasticsearch search engine. See https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/near-real-time.html for more information.

org-apache-felix-eventadmin-AsyncToSyncThreadRatio=Async/Sync Thread Pool Ratio
org-apache-felix-eventadmin-AsyncToSyncThreadRatio-help=Configure the ratio of asynchronous to synchronous threads in the internal thread pool. Ratio must be positive and may be adjusted to represent the distribution of post to send operations. Applications with a higher number of post operations should have a higher ratio.
org-apache-felix-eventadmin-IgnoreTimeout=Ignore Timeouts
org-apache-felix-eventadmin-IgnoreTimeout-help=Configure event handlers to be called without a timeout. If a timeout is configured by default, then all event handlers are called using the timeout. For performance optimization, it is possible to configure event handlers where the timeout handling is not used. This reduces the thread usage from the thread pools as the timeout handling requires an additional thread to call the event handler. However, the application should work without this configuration property. It is a pure optimization. The value is a list of strings. If a string ends with a dot, all handlers in exactly this package are ignored. If the string ends with a star, all handlers in this package and all subpackages are ignored. If the string neither ends with a dot nor with a star, this is assumed to define an exact class name.
org-apache-felix-eventadmin-IgnoreTopic=Ignore Topics
org-apache-felix-eventadmin-IgnoreTopic-help=Configure topics which are ignored by the event admin implementation for performance optimization. In this case, a event is not delivered to registered event handlers. The value is a list of strings (separated by comma). If a single value ends with a dot, all topics in exactly this package are ignored. If a single value ends with a star, all topics in this package and all sub packages are ignored. If a single value neither ends with a dot nor with a start, this is assumed to define an exact topic. A single star can be used to disable delivery completely.
org-apache-felix-eventadmin-RequireTopic=Require Topic
org-apache-felix-eventadmin-RequireTopic-help=Configure whether event handlers are required to be registered with a topic. This is enabled by default. The specification says that event handlers must register with a list of topics they are interested in. Disabling this setting will enable that handlers without a topic are receiving all events (i.e., they are treated the same as with a topic=*).
org-apache-felix-eventadmin-ThreadPoolSize=Thread Pool Size
org-apache-felix-eventadmin-ThreadPoolSize-help=Configure the size of the thread pool used for event delivery. The default value is 20. Increase in case of a large amount of events. A value of less then 2 triggers the default value. If the pool is exhausted, event delivery is blocked until a thread becomes available from the pool. Each event is delivered in a thread from the pool unless the ignore timeouts is configured for the receiving event handler.
org-apache-felix-eventadmin-Timeout=Timeout
org-apache-felix-eventadmin-Timeout-help=Configure the blacklist timeout in milliseconds. The default value is 5000. Increase or decrease at own discretion. A value of less than 100 turns timeouts off. Any other value is the time in milliseconds granted to each event handler before it gets blacklisted.
