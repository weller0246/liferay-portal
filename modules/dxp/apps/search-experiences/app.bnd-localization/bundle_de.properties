liferay-releng-app-description=The ${liferay.releng.app.title.prefix} Enterprise Search Experiences suite of applications unlocks the full power of Liferay's search framework for nondevelopers. This release introduces the "Search Blueprints" app, enabling search administrators to tweak Liferay's default search behavior or build completely custom search algorithms using a no-code visual query builder. Each Blueprint is composed of multiple "Elements"; where each Element influences the search query in some way. For example, one Element can hide content tagged "expired", another can ignore searching comments, while another Element can include fields normally ignored in the default search algorithm. Each Element is configurable using familiar UI controls like input fields, dropdown lists, and date pickers. Several Elements are available OOTB, for example Elements for boosting results by geolocation, content freshness, time-based conditional boosts, etc. Advanced users can create their own Elements to harness the full capabilities of Liferay's search framework.<br /><br />Blueprints are also context-aware, allowing personalized search results based on the user's profile, roles, location, local time, segment, etc. For example, a Blueprint can boost manufacturing industry case studies based on the user's email address or job title. Each search page can be associated to a different Blueprint, allowing unique search algorithms for different search use cases like intranets, commerce, and marketing sites. (Automatic Copy)
