Much of the functionality that belonged to Liferay's core prior to Liferay 7 has been extracted into the modules of the Foundation suite. The authentication modules provide a variety of mechanisms for allowing users and remote applications to authenticate to Liferay. The LDAP Authentication module allows administrators to establish connections to one or more LDAP directories from which users can be imported or exported. The SSO modules allow users to authenticate to Liferay using a variety of single-sign on solutions. The Token-based Authentication module allows users or remote applications to authenticate to Liferay without a password. The Scripting module allows scripts to be written in Groovy to invoke Liferay's API.<br /><br />This suite is available in the ${liferay.releng.app.title.prefix} bundle.
